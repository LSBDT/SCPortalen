## Introduction

Single-cell centric database

Single-cell omics recently emerged as powerful tools to investigate heterogeneity of large populations of cells. Among others, improvements in sequencing, microscopy and microfluidic technologies let to a rapid increase of complex datasets with single-cell resolution. However, due to a lack of available platforms to easily share and integrate complex single-cell datasets, the accessibility of such datasets can be a barrier to efficient usage. The number of publication in the area of single-cell increased in the recent years. Still we are lacking public single-cell database to facilitate and enable researchers to access and explore published single-cell datasets.

To address the above issue, we introduced a single-cell data integration platform. The motivation for the development of this database was to enable easy access, integration and collaboration on single-cell datasets generated by the research community worldwide. The current version of the database integrate of single-cell metadata, cell images and sequence information. As an added-value to the raw data, we performed manual curation and annotation of each dataset and conducted single-cell analysis of single-cell RNA-seq. The easy-to-use user interface of the database will enable biologist and computing researchers to search, explore, and download single-cell data and images.
